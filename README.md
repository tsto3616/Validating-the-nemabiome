Herein the R files "dada2_preparation.Rmd", "Pooling_thresholds_sequencing-depth_prep.Rmd" and "merging_species.Rmd" are sufficient for the preparation of the data. The remainer of the R files/ analyses are located within the experiment branches of the repository. 

Note the sequencing files are available under the labarchives file... FILL IN!!! 

The reference file (for AssignTaxonomy() in "dada2_preparation.Rmd") is available within this branch under the name "NEMA_USYD_ITS2_Database_assignTax_v3.fa"
