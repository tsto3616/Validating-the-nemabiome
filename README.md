# Validating-the-nemabiome
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a supplementary material to the study... in particular supplying the data sufficient for the reanalysis of results. All the code (contained in R files) is the exact code used to construct the study, allowing for the reconstruction of the experiments. We decided to split the repository into three sections: data preparation, the threshold experiments and the sequencing depth experiment.
