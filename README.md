# Validating-the-nemabiome
Herein the R files "dada2_preparation.Rmd", "Pooling_thresholds_sequencing-depth_prep.Rmd" and "merging_species.Rmd" are sufficient for the preparation of the data. The remainer of the R files/ analyses are located within the experiment branches of the repository. 

Note the sequencing files are available under the labarchives file... FILL IN!!! 

The "experimental_design" file explains the labels of the fasta files, which includes both primers, replicates and or lab pooling. 

The reference file (for AssignTaxonomy() in "dada2_preparation.Rmd") is available within this branch under the name "NEMA_USYD_ITS2_Database_assignTax_v3.fa"

The file needed for the "Pooling_thresholds_sequencing_depth_prep.Rmd" file is present under "ASVs_masterfile_prepooling.xlsx" in this branch.

The files needed for the "merging_species.Rmd" file are available under "rarefied_masterfile_nemabiome_2024.xlsx", "Thresholds_masterfile_nemabiome_2024.xlsx" and "raw_thresholds_masterfile_nemabiome_2024.xlsx".
